            <h1>Cat Stevens</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Born in 1948, Cat Stevens has been releasing music since 1967! And at the age of 74, heâ€™s still going.</p>
                <p>He was born Steven Demetre Georgiou. His girlfriend said he had the eyes of a cat. He thought his unusual name might keep him from getting famous, so he changed his name to Cat Stevens.</p>
                <h3>A few more details from Wikipedia:</h3>
                <blockquote class="dark">Yusuf Islam (born Steven Demetre Georgiou; 21 July 1948), commonly known by his stage names Cat Stevens, Yusuf, and Yusuf / Cat Stevens, is a British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His musical style consists of folk, pop, rock, and, later in his career, Islamic music. He returned to making secular music in 2006. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.</blockquote>
                <p>
                    A biography of Cat Stevens from the perspective of an avid fan who mourned the loss of his openness and enthusiasm for life can be found in this <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-unlikely-return-of-cat-stevens 
                    ">New Yorker</a> article.
                </p>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, he did not write the Cat's in the Cradle. People often associate the song with him because of his name, and the similar style in the same time period. But he never even remade it. It was actually written by Henry Chapin in 1974. See for yourself.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlECRynhqsk">Cat's in the Cradle</a></p>
                <p>He released 15 compilation albums between 1975 and 2013. I wonder if that's how he grew his fan base. One person on YouTube commented, "I'm 23, and I'm his biggest fan." I myself jumped on the train with his 1987 release, and I still find his songs inspiring. He has an impressive 387K subscribers to his personal YouTube channel. His songs, many of which are over 50 years old, have millions of views. The world is a better place because of the creativity and joy that he shared with the world through his music.</p>

                <p>Cell padding and border attributes are no longer used inside table tags. These should be handled using CSS, as all matters of style and layout are these days. Cell spacing is not allowed at all, and actually seems to have no effect.</p>
                <h3>YouTube video alerts</h3>
                <p>For accessibility purposes, all linked videos should have captions. Auto-generated captions are not very accurate, so captions should be verified to be accurate before linking a video. These videos are music videos and have no captions. One alternative would be to provide a link to the lyrics.</p>
